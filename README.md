# sak-productivity-suite
Stands for Swiss Army Knife Productivity Suite. This is a Chrome extension + webpage based on React.js with a Flask + PostgreSQL backend that allows you to send, receive LinkedIn messages, search profiles and send connect notes. Connect notes can be made personalized based on the person's interests (using BingChat). The cookie.json file is used for authentication with BingChat. Not included here is the Chrome extension which gets a profile's LinkedIn cookies for authentication. All of the features are tested and working. Future additions will hopefully include email + Whatsapp + Slack integration. Feel free to improve upon it :)
