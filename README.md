This is a project for a chrome extension based on React.js with a Flask backend that allows you to send, receive LinkedIn messages, send connect notes, making them personalized based on the person's interests (this uses BingChat). The project may need some setting up, but all of the features are tested and working. Feel free to improve upon it :)
